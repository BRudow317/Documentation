Agile Scrum training Pt 1 David@ToBeAgile.com
-- Building software
--How does this relate, or how is this different
--Costs half as much to build the software, than to fix bugs or change the software
Legacy Code- Code thats been written and is developed.
Paired and Mobbing - coding techniques that involve others
Stories - important aspect of agile based scrum.
Encapsulate - allows freedom to change things later.
--By definition, encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work 
--on that data within one unit, like a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the 
--internal representation, or state of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding.
TVD - Test Vs Development
Agile principles
-- Teams share backlog
-- Deliver Working software frequently
-- Do whats most important to the customer first
-- ideally 2 week sprints
Scrum Principles
Seven Stages of Scrum - 1) Break down work 2) Scrum Master supports the team 
--3) Product owner defines the product 4) Self Organized teams are empowered to find solutions
--5) Focused standards, practices for extensible code 
--6) Incremental build features incrementally and iterativelly 7) Joyful self directed and empowered teams
Cross Functional Teams - Eliminate wait states. Allow the team to build in progress. Eliminate
-- work in progress.
Five scrum Events - The Sprint 1) Planning, defining scope of work 2) Daily Scrum: Update progress
--3) Backglog Refinement: PO prioritizes upcoming backlog items
--4) Sprint Retrospective: discuss areas for small improvements
--5) Sprint Review: Demo what the team just accomplished.
Continuous Integration - Branching code bases, Scrum uses trunk based CI
Extreme Programming - right method for developing software


Scrum Day 2:
Test driven development - write the next test before any others, then implement the test.
-- Allows you to address defects immediately before moving on, potentially by 80%
Refactoring Code - Changing the design of the code without changing the behavior of the code.
-- The team learns in chunks, allows to go back and implement new ideas and techniques that improve 
Technical Debt - cost to poorly produced code.
Unit Tests - testible units of behavior, Test first development,
